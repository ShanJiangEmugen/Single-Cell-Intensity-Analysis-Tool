    "## How this works\n",
    "Idea for this function is to compare cells in different channels, for example, you want to see how many GFP cells are NueN cells based on NeuN masking. This part will do the mask on a channel that you want to check total number of cells, then, apply this mask to the channels you want to do the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function will do the \"normal\" cell masking processes as above to track cells based on 2 channels, outputing results folders.Then, do the comparison based on the outputs. It will return the ratios such as how many cells are valid cells in given range and how many cells are both in selected channels.\n",

    "- **cellpose_ch**: the channel you want to get mask from   \n",
    "- **mask_ch1, mask_ch2**: the mask will be applied to these 2 channels    \n",
    "- **low_bound_ch{n}, up_bound_ch{n}**: valid boundary for ch{n} masking, filter out all cells that out of this range in both `mean` and `median` results\n",
    "  - you might want to do a test run for these parameters, since different images have different conditions, such as background intensity\n",
    "- **group_info**: self defined `group_info` from above    \n",
    "- **measurments**: either `mean` or `median`, for comparison   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Outputs\n",
    "- **ch1%**: % cells in first channel in boundary [low_bound_ch1, up_bound_ch1]\n",
    "- **ch2%**: % cells in second channel in boundary [low_bound_ch2, up_bound_ch2]\n",
    "- **ch1 in ch2%**: % valid cells in ch2 that also in valid ch1\n",
